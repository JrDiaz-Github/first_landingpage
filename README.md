# first_landingpage
A practice landing page from lessons by TheOdinProject

This page was based on a default page layout provided by TheOdinProject, which I then recreated and modified to practice CSS and HTML. I decided to make a page about Ado, because she's been a bit of a recent obssession of mine.

I used flexboxes quite a bit here, not entirely sure if it was a wise decision, might review block and inline elements and see if I can simplify the css and html some, since there was quite a bit of nesting in some cases.
